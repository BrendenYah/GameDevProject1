# GameDevProject1
Game dev project featuring a soccer ball trying to knock over soccer players. 


To-Do List:
- Controller support
- Code enemy
- Rewrite player movement to account for Time.deltaTime. The video I used for player rotations seems to be a good starting place for this. The same YouTube account has a video on how to implement slowing down time, a feature I wanted to implement when an enemy is taken out, or the player is kicked.

Completed:
- Correct player movement
- Correct dashd
- Animate player
	- Correct orientation while moving.
